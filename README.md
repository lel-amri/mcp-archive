# An archive of the original Mod Coder Pack

If you're looking for recent (as of 2023) Minecraft modding, please use
[MinecraftForge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) or
[MCP-Reborn](https://github.com/Hexeption/MCP-Reborn).

If you're looking for an archive of the original MCP, keep reading.

This is a convenient repository of all the (seemingly official) versions I
could find on the Internet. The original releases distributed binaries, which
are present in this repository, making it unusually big for its purpose. I made
the intentional choice of not removing binaries to keep each commit as close as
the original archives as possible.

Please, see the branch `repo-builder` for information on how this repository
was built.

If I understand the license of MCP correctly, I might not have the right to
provide MCP in this form, but I don't want this to disappear, so here it is.
