Things required to run:

- Those scripts need to be moved in the root directory of MCP before using them.
- wine to run jad and jadretro. We know, there are linux binaries of jad BUT those are v1.5.8e, we need 1.5.8g
- python to run some of the tools
- (linux version of the natives in jars/bin/natives to run the game, everything else can be used from the windows .minecraft folder as far as i tested, might be wrong though, so use the linux stuff for linux use :D)
- The absolute pathname of the MCP root directory has to be very short.  The easiest way is to create a symlink into /tmp and run it from there:

$ ln -s /path/to/mcp_root_dir /tmp/mcp
$ cd /tmp/mcp
$ ./decompile.sh
