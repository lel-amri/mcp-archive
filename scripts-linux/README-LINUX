Things required to run:

- Those scripts need to be moved in the root directory of MCP before using them.
- wine to run jad and jadretro. We know, there are linux binaries of jad BUT those are v1.5.8e, we need 1.5.8g
- python to run some of the tools
- (linux version of the natives in jars/bin/natives to run the game, everything else can be used from the windows .minecraft folder as far as i tested, might be wrong though, so use the linux stuff for linux use :D)
